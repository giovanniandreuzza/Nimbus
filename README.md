Nimbus is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that makes it quick and easy to download any file in your
app, whether it's a large image, a video, or a PDF.
It exposes low-level APIs to manage downloads with the provider you love the most and to store the
downloaded files in the location you prefer.

You heard it right! Nimbus is designed to be easily integrated into Android, iOS, and KMM.
It allows you to download files via Internet, via Bluetooth, or from any other source you can think.
Store the file in the location you prefer, whether it's in the app's cache, in the app's files, or
even in a remote location.
